    /// ## Discussion
    ///
    /// The update operation basically works in three modes, depending on whether the database of certificates
    /// is empty, or not.
    /// 1. If database of certificates is empty, the the **"immediate"** update is enforced and the "completion" block
    ///    is called after the update is finished. This basically means that the application has to wait for
    ///    certificate fetch.
    ///
    /// 2. If there are some certificates, but some is expire soon, then the **"silent"** update mode is applied
    ///    and the `completion` block is immediately scheduled to the `completionQueue` with `ok` result.
    ///    The update of certificates is performed silently by the library. The silent update is also performed
    ///    periodically, once per week by default.
    ///
    /// 3. If there are some certificates and none is closing to its expiration date, then the `completion`
    ///    block is immediately scheduled to the `completionQueue` with `ok` result.
    ///
    /// - Parameter mode: Mode of update operation (`.default` is recommended)
    /// - Parameter completionQueue: The completion queue for scheduling the completion block callback. The default is `.main`.
    /// - Parameter completion: The completion closure called at the end of operation, with following parameters:
    /// - Parameter result: Resut of the update operation
    /// - Parameter error: An optional error, returned in case that operation failed on communication with the remote location.
